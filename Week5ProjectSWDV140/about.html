      <p>
Spot was founded by Stephanie H Roomba, a parent to over 8 different pets, some of them with special needs, and requiring constant supervision. Stephanie understands the obstacles that many other pet owners have to overcome if they want to leave home for a day or two, and 
thats exactly what she wishes to eliminate. Here at Spot, our compassion for delivering the best service to both you and your pets is unmatched. And quite literally, we do our absolute best to make sure that our sitters are safe, 
qualified, and trained on the do's and dont's of another person's pet. Spot believes that every pet should be treated by their sitter with the same quality of care and affection that they receive from their owners. That is why we 
work to provide a service that will keep pets happy and parents' minds at ease. 

In the rare instance that something goes wrong during a booking, Spot offers emergency medical reimbursement for all services booked through us. Simply put, this is our commitment to the well-being of your animals. On top of that, we
 are more than ready to accomodate for animals with special needs. If your animal has separation anxiety or is prone to seizures, all you need to do is mention it to us, and we will provide you with an appropriately trained sitter 
who will go the extra mile for you.

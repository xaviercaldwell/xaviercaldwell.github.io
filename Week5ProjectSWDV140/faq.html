    	<h1>FAQs</h1>
		<h2><a href="#">How does Spot verify sitters?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
        	Sitters are required to go through an application portal that asks them what kind of experience with animals they have and what kind of animals they prefer and are able to handle. For you and your pet's safety, federal background checks are also mandatory for all applicants.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">Why use Spot?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>It's reliable. If your sitter cancels, we will find a replacement in no time.</li>
				<li>It's fast, and can be used on short notice, no more planning weeks ahead.</li>
				<li>Stay updated with your sitter at any given time with constant communication, should you want it.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">What payment options are there?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>To streamline payments for our sitters, and for legality, we require that some form of online payment be on file for all spot users, so that we can pay our sitters for a job well done.
			</p>
      <p>Online payments include any debit and/or credit cards, PayPal, Apple pay, and Google Pay. </p>
		</div>
    <h2><a href="#">My pet has special needs, is that okay?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			Of course! Just let your sitter know what needs to be accomodated for, and if they need to give your pet a pill at a specific time, you can bet that they'll be on top of it!
			</p> 
		</div>
    <h2><a href="#">Can I leave a tip?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			Yes, there is an option when making your payment that will allow you to leave a tip by charging you extra by a specified amount that you set.
			</p>
		</div>
    <h2><a href="#">I wont be away from home as long as I thought, can I cancel mid-sit?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			If you decide to return early you will obligated to pay the sitter based on the amount of completed time, along with a fee to compensate the sitter for an early cancellation. The fee will be based on how early/late you decide to cancel. 
			</p>
		</div>
    <h2><a href="#">What kind of activity can I expect my sitter to do with my pets?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			If you have a preferred method of exercise for your animal, such as going for a walk or playing catch, sitters can incorporate it into their time at your home.
			</p>
		</div>
    <h2><a href="#">Do sitters have to stay on my property?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			Sitters are encouraged to stay within a mile radius of your home, even when leaving for walks and going outdoors for playtime.
			</p>
			<p>
			If you prefer that your sitter stay indoors during the entirety of their stay, there is an option when requesting a sitter that your pet is an "indoor animal," and will prevent your sitter from leaving your home.
		</div>
    <h2><a href="#">Can the sitter take my pet to the park?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			Sitters are <u>not</u> allowed to take your pet to settings in which they can reasonably assume that other animals are present. This is for your pet's safety. In the event that your pet is in anyway hurt, sitters are <u>required</u> to communicate with you, and take them to an emergency vet.

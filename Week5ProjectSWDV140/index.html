        Spot is a reliable, "on the spot" pet sitting service that is ready to take care of your furry friends on the double! We here at Spot understand what it is like to try to find a pet sitter amongst your family or friends, and 
        the dread you feel when you can't find one. The purpose of Spot is to connect pet parents with a network of animal lovers who are ready to take care of your pets for a much more reasonable price than a traditional boarding kennel, 
        and to remove the hassle of going out to an external doggy daycare (especially if they dont fit your hours). However, if you would like a Spot Sitter to come back to your home at a certain time each day
        while you're on vacation, we are more than happy to work around your schedule. Spot Sitters are more than happy to exercise and play with your animals, and perform whatever routines you may have your pet accustomed to. 
        Spot charges based on the hours that a sitter is present and taking care of your 
        animal, and we boast competitive rates, that get cheaper per hour the longer the time commitment for your sitter. While on the job, sitters are required to send proof of their care, such as by providing videos of them walking your dog. 
        Background checks and safety trainings are done before sitters are allowed to partner with us, to ensure the safety of yourself, your property, and your pets.

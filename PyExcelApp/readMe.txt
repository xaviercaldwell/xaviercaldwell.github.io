This is a Python App prototype, meaning that it is not finished, nor while it be probably for a long time. as can be assumed, all .py files 
are python code, and all .xlsx files are spreadsheets. .csv are text files, and running through each .py file, you can see how they are supposed to read a given file,
and translate the information into an excel spreadsheet.

Thank you for reading
